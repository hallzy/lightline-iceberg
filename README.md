# lightline-iceberg

Below is a picture of the iceberg colorscheme in vim along with how lightline
looks with four different vim modes.

This is an [itchyny](https://github.com/itchyny) / [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim)
theme for [cocopon](https://github.com/cocopon) / [iceberg.vim](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim).

I used the same colour codes used in the original iceberg theme, so the colours
should match.
